# 📘 Vocal Grader - Grammer Scoring Engine 

The **Vocal Grader** is a Python-based AI system that evaluates the grammatical correctness of spoken audio inputs. It uses speech-to-text and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze user speech and generate a grammar score.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ Converts audio input to text using speech recognition.
- ✍️ Evaluates grammatical accuracy using NLP models.
- 📊 Returns a grammar score with explanation for feedback.
- 💾 Designed for educational assessments, interviews, and learning tools.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- SpeechRecognition
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- TextBlob / LanguageTool / Grammar-checking libraries
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧪 How it Works

1. **Audio Input**: User provides a `.wav` audio file.
2. **Speech Recognition**: Audio is transcribed to text.
3. **Grammar Analysis**: The text is analyzed for grammar issues.
4. **Score Calculation**: A score is generated based on correctness, complexity, and error count.
