        "# Grammar Scoring Engine - Report\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "This notebook tackles the Grammar Scoring Engine Kaggle challenge, where the goal is to predict grammar scores (0–5) from .wav audio recordings using machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Approach\n",
        "1. **Audio Transcription**: We use OpenAI's `whisper` model to convert audio to text.\n",
        "2. **Grammar Feature Extraction**: Using `language_tool_python`, we extract grammatical error features like the number of grammar/spelling errors and sentence statistics.\n",
        "3. **Feature Engineering**: We compute text-based features such as word count, sentence count, average sentence length, etc.\n",
        "4. **Modeling**: A `RandomForestRegressor` is trained on these features to predict grammar scores.\n",
        "5. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric and predictions are rounded to the nearest integer between 1 and 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Preprocessing\n",
        "- Audio files are transcribed using Whisper.\n",
        "- Texts are cleaned and processed using LanguageTool for grammar checks.\n",
        "- Extracted features include:\n",
        "  - Grammar errors\n",
        "  - Spelling errors\n",
        "  - Sentence count\n",
        "  - Word count\n",
        "  - Average sentence length\n",
        "\n",
        "## Pipeline Architecture\n",
        "1. Load audio and labels\n",
        "2. Transcribe using Whisper\n",
        "3. Analyze with LanguageTool\n",
        "4. Feature extraction\n",
        "5. Train/test split\n",
        "6. Model training and prediction\n",
        "7. RMSE calculation and submission formatting\n",
        "\n",
        "## Results\n",
        "The initial model achieved a leaderboard RMSE of **~0.398**. Future improvements may include:\n",
        "- Fine-tuning Whisper or using larger models\n",
        "- Incorporating prosodic/audio features (e.g., pitch, pace, pauses)\n",
        "- Experimenting with more advanced regressors or ensemble methods\n"

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
